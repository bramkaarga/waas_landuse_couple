"What are the merits of endogenising land-use change dynamics into model-based climate adaptation planning?"
(https://doi.org/10.18174/sesmo.2019a16126)

There are five experiments in the case study:

| No  | Main questions | Uncertainties | Policies | Endogenised land-use? |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | How does future climate change development influence the impact of endogenising land-use dynamics? | Climate change | Standard policies | Both – yes and no |
| 2  | How does future socioeconomic development influence the impact of endogenising land-use dynamics? | Socioeconomic (land-use claim) | Standard policies | Both – yes and no |
| 3  | How does the society’s sensitivity to flood events influence the impact of endogenising land-use dynamics? | Climate change + flood sensitivity threshold | No policy | Both – yes and no |
| 4  | How does endogenising land-use dynamics affect the performance of each policy option? | Climate change + Socioeconomic | Standard policies | Both – yes and no |
| 5  | What are the implications of adding land-use based policies and indicators on top of the standard ones? | Climate change + Socioeconomic | Standard policies + Zoning policy | Yes |
